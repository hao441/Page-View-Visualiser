# Page View Time Series Visualizer

## Introduction
Page View Time Series Visualizer will visualise time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. It uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualise a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualisations will identify the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## Context
This project was developed as part of my FreeCodeAcademy - Data Analysis with Python course. My project was originally developed on replit, you can access it through this link: https://replit.com/@HarrisonO2/page-view-time-series-visualizer
